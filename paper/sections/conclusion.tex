DeepHTE provides a principled integration of deep learning with causal
inference through the enriched structural models framework. By treating
neural network outputs as parameter functions within a well-defined statistical
model, the approach achieves the flexibility of deep learning while maintaining
the inferential rigor of structural econometrics.

Monte Carlo simulations demonstrate that the method outperforms alternatives
with linear CATE assumptions when true heterogeneity is nonlinear. The key
advantage is individual treatment effect recovery, which is essential for
personalized decision-making. The approach extends naturally to non-tabular
covariates through appropriate neural network architectures.

Future work includes extensions to instrumental variables settings, panel data
with individual fixed effects, and dynamic treatment regimes. The theoretical
framework also admits extensions to more complex structural models beyond
treatment effects.
